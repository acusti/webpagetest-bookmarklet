WebPageTest Bookmarklet
=======================

A bookmarklet to make it easy to run load tests for your current page using [WebPageTest][]. See it in action on [this codepen][].

The built (and escaped and `href`-ified) version that you can specify as the URL for your bookmark is [bookmarklet-url.txt][bookmarklet-url]. Itâ€™s humongous because I inlined ReactJS to make it work with CSP pages. This has the unfortunate side effect of making it not work in Safari, which cuts off the length of a bookmark URL.
